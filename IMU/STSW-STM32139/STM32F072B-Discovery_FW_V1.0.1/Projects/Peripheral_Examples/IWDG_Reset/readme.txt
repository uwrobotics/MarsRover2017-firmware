@par IWDG_Reset Description 

  This example shows how to update at regular period the IWDG reload counter and 
  how to simulate a software fault generating an MCU IWDG reset on expiry of a 
  programmed time period.

  The IWDG timeout is set to 250 ms (the timeout may vary due to LSI frequency 
  dispersion).

  First, the TIM14 timer is configured to measure the LSI frequency as the 
  LSI is internally connected to TIM14 CH1, in order to adjust the IWDG clock.

  The LSI measurement using the TIM14 is described below:
   - Configure the TIM14 to remap internally the TIM14 CH1 Input Capture to the LSI
     clock output.
   - Enable the TIM14 Input Capture interrupt: after one cycle of LSI clock, the
     period value is stored in a variable and compared to the HCLK clock to get
     its real value. 

  Then, the IWDG reload counter is configured as below to obtain 250 ms according 
  to the measured LSI frequency after setting the prescaler value:
  
       IWDG counter clock Frequency = LSI Frequency / Prescaler value

  The IWDG reload counter is refreshed each 240 ms in the main program infinite 
  loop to prevent a IWDG reset.
  
  LED5 is also toggled each 240 ms indicating that the program is running.

  An EXTI Line is connected to a GPIO pin, and configured to generate an interrupt
  on the rising edge of the signal.

  The EXTI Line is used to simulate a software failure: once the EXTI Line event 
  occurs, by pressing the user push-button, the corresponding interrupt is 
  served. In the ISR, a write to invalid address generates a Hardfault exception 
  containing an infinite loop and preventing to return to main program (the IWDG 
  reload counter is not refreshed).
  As a result, when the IWDG counter reaches 00h, the IWDG reset occurs.
  
  If the IWDG reset is generated, after the system resumes from reset, LED3 turns on.
  If the EXTI Line event does not occur, the IWDG counter is indefinitely refreshed
  in the main program infinite loop, and there is no IWDG reset.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F072xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F072B-DISCO RevB
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32F072B-DISCO Set-up
    - LED3 and LED5 are used in this example.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
