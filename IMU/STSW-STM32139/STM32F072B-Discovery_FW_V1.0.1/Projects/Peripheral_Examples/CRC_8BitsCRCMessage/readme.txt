@par CRC_8BitsCRCMessage Description 

This example aims to show how to use the CRC peripheral in order to compute
8-bit CRC checksum of a message.
The CRC peripheral is configured to use the 8-bit CRC polynomial
x8 + x7 + x6 + x4 + x2 + 1 with the initialization value is set to 0.
The message is declared as an array and labeled "CRCBuffer".
Once the CRC value is computed, the computed CRC value is compared to the expected
one. In case of match the green led LED5 is turned on. Otherwise the led LED3 is turned on.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F072xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F072B-DISCO RevB
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32F072B-DISCO Set-up
    - LED5 and LED3 are used in this example.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 + EWARM
    - Open the CRC_8BitsCRCMessage.eww workspace 
    - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
    - Load project image: Project->Debug
    - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)
    
  + MDK-ARM
    - Open the CRC_8BitsCRCMessage.uvproj project.
    - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all target files.
    - Load project image: Debug->Start/Stop Debug Session.
    - Run program: Debug->Run (F5).

 + TrueSTUDO
    - Open the TrueSTUDIO toolchain.
    - Click on File->Switch Workspace->Other and browse to TrueSTUDIO workspace
      directory.
    - Click on File->Import, select General->'Existing Projects into Workspace'
      and then click "Next".
    - Browse to the TrueSTUDIO workspace directory, select the project.
    - Rebuild all project files: Select the project in the "Project explorer" 
      window then click on Project->build project menu.
    - Run program: Run->Debug (F11).
