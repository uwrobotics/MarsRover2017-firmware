@par ADC_DMA Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC1 and DMA to transfer continuously 
converted data from ADC1 to memory.
The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously channel12.
Each time an end of conversion occurs the DMA transfers, in circular mode, the
converted data from ADC1 DR register to the uhADC1ConvertedValue variable.

The converted value can be monitored by adding the variable "uhADC1ConvertedValue" 
to the debugger watch window.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F072xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F072B-DISCO RevB 
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    
  - STM32F072B-DISCO Set-up
    - Connect the external signal(ranges from 0 to 3.0V) to the ADC1 pin (PC.02) to be converted.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 + EWARM
    - Open the ADC_DMA.eww workspace 
    - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
    - Load project image: Project->Debug
    - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)
  + MDK-ARM
    - Open the ADC_DMA.uvproj project.
    - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all target files.
    - Load project image: Debug->Start/Stop Debug Session.
    - Run program: Debug->Run (F5).

 + TrueSTUDO
    - Open the TrueSTUDIO toolchain.
    - Click on File->Switch Workspace->Other and browse to TrueSTUDIO workspace
      directory.
    - Click on File->Import, select General->'Existing Projects into Workspace'
      and then click "Next".
    - Browse to the TrueSTUDIO workspace directory, select the project.
    - Rebuild all project files: Select the project in the "Project explorer" 
      window then click on Project->build project menu.
    - Run program: Run->Debug (F11).
