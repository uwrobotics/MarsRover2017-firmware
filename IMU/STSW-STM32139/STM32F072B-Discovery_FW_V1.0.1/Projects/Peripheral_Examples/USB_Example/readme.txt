@par Example Description 

This Example provides a description of how to use the USB-FS-Device on the STM32F072B-Disco board.
The STM32 device is enumerated as HID compliant device, that uses the native PC 
Host USB-FS-Device HID driver. Leds, User button and Linear touch sensor LS1 are enabled.
   
To test the example, you need to:

  1)- Start the "USB HID Demonstrator" PC applet and connect STM32 USB to PC
  2)- The device should be detected and shown in the USB HID target box of
      "USB HID Demonstrator" application. 
  3)- Press Graphic View button
  4)- You can Select "use SET_FEATURE" or "use SET_REPORT" in order to use SET_REPORT request to send HID Report
       for LED control
  5)- Make sure that following report ID are configured: LED1 ID (0x1) , LED2 ID(0x2),
       LED3 ID(0x3), LED4 ID(0x4), and BUTTON1_ID(0x5)
  6)- Select Leds to switch on/off on the Discovery board => a SET_REPORT request will be sent
  7)- "Variable Input" scrollbar on "USB HID Demonstrator" application configured
      to detect finger’s position on the discovery Linear Sensor  
  8)- Press User buttons on Discovery board, then Button1 box will light.
     


@par Hardware and Software environment 

   - This example runs on STM32F072xB devices
   - This example has been tested with STM32072B-DISCO and can be easily tailored
     to any other supported device and development board.

   - STM32072B-DISCO Set-up
       - Use CN2 connector to connect the board to a PC host through USB cable
       - you can download "USB HID Demonstrator" PC applet from 
        http://www.st.com/web/catalog/tools/FM147/CL1794/SC961/SS1533/PF257920
