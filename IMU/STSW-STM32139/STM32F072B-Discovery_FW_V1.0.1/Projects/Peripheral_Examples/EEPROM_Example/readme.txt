@par EEPROM_Example Description 

This example describes how to use the I2C to communicate with EEPROM memory.
Before starting test, a check is done to verify existence of EEPROM device. If
an EEPROM is connected, the test will be done otherwise LED3 turns ON indicating 
the absence of the EEPROM.
After I2C and IOs configuration, a first write operation is done. Then a read 
operation is made and the written and read values are compared. If the result of 
comparison is OK, LED5 turns on. Otherwise LED3 turns ON.
Once this test finish, a second write operation is done. Then a read 
operation is made and the written and read values are compared. If the result of 
comparison is OK, LED6 turns on. Otherwise LED3 turns ON.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F072xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F072B-DISCO RevB
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    
  - Plug RF EEPROM daughter board ANT7-M24LR-A into connector CN3 of STM32F072B-DISCO board.
